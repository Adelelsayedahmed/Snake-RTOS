# Snake-Game-Using-Our-Implemented-RTOS
Implementing snake game using microcontroller tm4c123gh6pm with RTOS

## Main Project Components
1) Design and implement **our Kernel** (scheduler and context switching )  
2) kernel supports interrupts and semaphores 
3) snake game which is implemented with many tasks schadeuled by our RTOS 


## Kernel Features : 
1) scheduling between tasks and make a context switching 
2) Handles intterupts 
3) Handling the concurrency issues between tasks with mutex regions
4) Create a new task , Remove a task

## Snake game Features :
